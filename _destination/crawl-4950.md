**STAR FAILS**

**EPISODE III**

**REVENGE OF THE SYNC**

It is a time of doomed transfers.
The Copy Alliance, led by the brave yet misguided developers,
is attempting to complete the impossible mission of syncing files across the galaxy.

But deep within the code, a fatal flaw lurks.
Despite countless retries and valiant efforts, the system is destined to fail spectacularly.
File conflicts, overwrites, and unexpected crashes plague their every move.

The forces of `CrashLoopBackOff` have seized control,
sending the once-hopeful project spiraling into a `CRASHLOOPBACKOFF` state.
Now, as hope fades, only the most stubborn of scripts stand between the developers and total transfer FAILUREâ€¦
